## Todo
- None

## How to Use
There are probably better ways to implement Schema on a website, but this is super simple and works for our specific use case, so it's what we use.

Basically:
1. Write the article in question and make sure everything is reviewed and ready for publication.
2. Copy any FAQ sections into the Schema template, making sure to format them for Google Search as necessary.
3. Copy and Paste the finished Schema template into the Google Rich Results Test (https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) and make sure everything populates properly.
4. Copy and paste the finished Schema template into a HTML block in WordPress, usually at the bottom of the article.
5. Publish the final article, then double-check the Schema is working by checking it against the Google Rich Results Test again.
